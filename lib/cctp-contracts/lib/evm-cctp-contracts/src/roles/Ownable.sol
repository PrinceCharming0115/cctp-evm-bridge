 * @dev forked from https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/7c5f6bc2c8743d83443fa46395d75f2f3f99054a/contracts/access/Ownable.sol
 * Modifications:
 * 1. Update Solidity version from 0.8.0 to 0.7.6 (11/9/2022). (v8 was used
 * as base because it includes internal _transferOwnership method.)
 * 2. Remove renounceOwnership function
 *
 * Description
 * Contract module which provides a basic access control mechanism, where
 * there is an account (an owner) that can be granted exclusive access to
 * specific functions.
 *
 * By default, the owner account will be the one that deploys the contract. This
 * can later be changed with {transferOwnership}.
 *
 * This module is used through inheritance. It will make available the modifier
 * `onlyOwner`, which can be applied to your functions to restrict their use to
 * the owner.
